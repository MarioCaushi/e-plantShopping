# Paradise Nursery Shopping Application - ReactJS

Welcome to the Paradise Nursery Shopping Application! This project is a front-end web application developed using ReactJS that enables users to browse a selection of houseplants, manage their shopping cart, and view cart details before proceeding to checkout.

## Project Origin

This project is forked from the [IBM Developer Skills Network repository](https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network). The initial project provided a template that included only the landing page and basic styling for the product listing page. All functionalities related to the shopping cart and product listing logic have been implemented by me.

## Project Overview

The application consists of three main pages:

1. **Landing Page**: Introduction to Paradise Nursery
2. **Product Listing Page**: Browse and select houseplants
3. **Shopping Cart Page**: View and manage items in the cart

## Features

### Landing Page
- **Background Image**: A visually appealing image representing Paradise Nursery.
- **Company Introduction**: A paragraph providing information about the company.
- **Company Name**: Prominently displayed.
- **Get Started Button**: Redirects to the product listing page.

### Product Listing Page
- **Plant Categories**: Organized into three or more categories.
- **Plant Details**:
  - Thumbnail Image

  - Total Number of Plants
  - Total Cost of All Items

- **Buttons**:
